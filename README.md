# Classification-of-Iris-Species-Using-a-Deep-Neural-Network-with-TensorFlow
This project uses TensorFlow to classify Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) with a neural network. It includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation, with inline Colab visualizations of loss, accuracy, and confusion matrix. Training completes in under 5 minutes, achieving high accuracy.
